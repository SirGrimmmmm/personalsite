        <h2>Hello! I'm Adriane Miles Aspiras.</h2>
        <p>I have to not harden my heart, because I want to stay open to feel things. So when I hurt, I hurt all over. And when I cry, I cry real hard. And when I’m mad, I’m mad all over. I’m just a person; I like to experience whatever the feeling is and whatever I’m going through. The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain. - <em><b>Dolly Parton</b></em></p>

          <h3>Teamwork Basketball</h3>
          <p>They'll learn how to cooperate with their team and build a sense of camaraderie. Teamwork also means respect for each other. Even from the beginning, basketball included rules against harming one another. Kids will learn life lessons about playing competitively but still maintaining a sense of safety.</p>

          <p>Safety over Speed! Leave sooner, drive slower, live longer. You simply cannot drive forward if you're focused on what's happening in the rear view mirror. Step in the car with no worries! You will be at your destination, in time and alive.</p>
